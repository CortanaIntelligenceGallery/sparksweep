# Parameter Sweep on Spark

This sample shows how to leverage the [_spark-sklearn_ package](https://spark-packages.org/package/databricks/spark-sklearn) in parallel to perform parameter sweep on Spark worker nodes, and compare that with the regular parameter sweep performed in scikit-learn.

It also shows how to add [published Spark packages](https://spark-packages.org/) to your project using the _Spark_dependencies.yml_ file in the _aml_config_ folder.
